# Sparse Matrix Multiplication
### Problem Description
The question asks to write a program to perform multiplication of two sparse matrices.
1. First, user is asked to input the dimensions of Matrix A (m x n) and Matrix B (n x k);
1. Then the program should generate two random sparse matrices with the corresponding dimensions, and the sparsities of both matrices are 0.95 (i.e., 95% of the elements in a matrix are zero). The non-zero elements are generated uniformly at random, and take random values from 2.0 to 15.5. 
1. The question asks to design an **efficient sparse matrix multiplication algorithm** to multiply A and B. 
1. The naive matrix multiplication method is also required to be implemented, and its running time is compared with that of the sparse matrix multiplication algorithm.
