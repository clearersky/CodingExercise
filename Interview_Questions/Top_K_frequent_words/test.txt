The loss of helium on Earth would affect society greatly. Defying the perception of it as a novelty substance for parties and gimmicks, the element actually has many vital applications in society. Probably the most well known commercial usage is in airships and blimps nonflammable helium replaced hydrogen as the lifting gas du jour after the Hindenburg catastrophe in, during which an airship burst into flames and crashed to the ground killing some passengers and crew. But helium is also instrumental in deepsea diving, where it is blended with nitrogen to mitigate the dangers of inhaling ordinary air under high pressure; as a cleaning agent for rocket engines; and, in its most prevalent use, as a coolant for superconducting magnets in hospital MRI magnetic resonance imaging scanners.
